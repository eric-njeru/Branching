    <h1> Branching </h1>
    <h2> A website to practice branching with Git. </h2>
    <h3> Author: Eric Njeru </h2>
    <p>In this document we discussed Git's branching behavior and the git branch command. The git branch commands primary functions are to create, list, rename and delete branches. To operate further on the resulting branches the command is commonly used with other commands like git checkout.</p>
    <p> This page has been created in order to practice branching with Git and GitHub. By creating branches, we can work on different versions of the same code in the same repository simultaneously!  </p>
